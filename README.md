# Tactile Goban

This is a tactile 9x9 go board.

It is not that easy to find a tacticle go board, for example for visually impaired people.

## Limitations

A go board has a ratio of 15:14 to compensate for the players viewing angle of the board.
This is a little bit nerve wrecking to draw in inkscape vector graphics, so the ratio of this board is 1:1.

Line spacing is 23,5 x 23,5 mm, the board size is 20,8 x 20,8 cm.
It is a beginners board in the size of 9x9.

## Files

* goban.svg - Vector graphic of the board, speperated colors for cutout, holes and lines (best laser cut as hatched)
* go-stone-concave.stl - Concave stone for 3D printing
* go-stone-convex.stl - Convex stone for 3D printing

* go-stone.scad - Source file for the 3D model, stones can be customized

## Making

You can lasercut the tactile board with teh goban.svg. In my tests acrylic glass worked best, because it is easier to create the tactile hatched lines. If you are using fine ply wood, play around with different hatching parameters and line sizes.

Print the stl Files on a 3D Printer or order them at a printing service like Shapeways.
A beginners board usually comes with 80 stones in total.

## Example build

Here are some pictures of an example build:

Have fun.
